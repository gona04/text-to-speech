This application is an attempt to create a diary that can help track the mental health issues of the person who makes regular entries in the diary. 

Currently, I have added live speech-to-text conversion and also uploaded an audio (format WAV only) facility. 

Note: The test cases are yet in the test case branch because some of the test cases have gone wrong. Need more time to work on it thus they are in a different branch as of now
